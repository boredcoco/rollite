Motivation

Games are a great way to unwind and destress. Bullet-hell games are particularly entertaining because they can provide an adrenaline rush, involve skill and test the player’s reaction time. Moreover, multiplayer games are an especially engaging way to connect with friends.

Ever played a multiplayer bullet-hell game where the enemy is your friend? Instead of a game where attack patterns can be memorised and the game gets repetitive and boring, every time you play our game will be a unique experience. You or your friend will get to decide whether you want to make things easy for each other.

As people who play quite a number of games ourselves, we were eager for this opportunity to start learning game design and construction so we may expand on more complicated ideas.

Aim 

Rollite will be a Multiplayer bullet-hell game. Rollite’s gameplay will be inspired by bullet-hell games like Just Shapes and Beats.

Our goal is for Rollite to be an exciting game that tests player reflexes while encouraging friendly competition between players.

In the future, we want to implement Single Player mode so that the protagonist can play against an AI antagonist.

User Stories

As a student who is bored while waiting for his tutorial to begin, I would want to play a game that starts and ends quickly and does not require saving.

As a busy student, I would like an enjoyable game that is easy to pick up and put down and requires very little time for an entertaining experience.

As a gamer, I enjoy a fast-paced, exciting experience that doesn’t require a lot of skill to play.

As a gamer, I enjoy bonding with my friends through games that don’t take very long to play so that we can easily fit time in both our schedules.

User Profiling

We have identified two likely types of players.
Users who are looking for a fast-paced game with low commitment as a fun bonding activity with friends.
More competitive users looking for friendly competition or to test their skills.

Scope of Project

Rollite is a fast-paced, Multiplayer bullet-hell game. 

The game revolves around the player (or player sprite) trying to dodge bullet patterns and other attacks thrown at them. Another player acts as the “antagonist” who chooses what kinds of attacks to throw at the protagonist and where to place them. 

The antagonist will decide where to place their chosen attack using a mouse, allowing both players to play on the same laptop. This mode is generally more engaging because one can interact with their friends and compete with them, taking turns to be “protagonist” or “antagonist”.

Because a human player is the antagonist, they have the power to determine the difficulty of the game based on how aggressive they choose to be.

Protagonist points will be accumulated based on how long they survive during the game. When certain point milestones are met, new attacks will be unlocked for the antagonist in order to ramp up the difficulty of the game.

















Core Features

Dashing:
The player will be able to dash a short distance to escape attacks. However, dashing will deplete the protagonist’s stamina.

Stamina Bar:
Both players will have a stamina bar. The stamina bar limits how often the protagonist can dash, while limiting how often and what types of attacks can be used by the antagonist in order to make the game more fair.

Stamina will regenerate over time when the protagonist does not dash or the antagonist does not attack.

Portals:
When the Portal buff is collected by the protagonist, a pair of portals will randomly spawn on the map, allowing the player to teleport between them. This can help the protagonist escape attacks.

Shields:
When the Shield buff is collected by the protagonist, they instantly gain a shield that protects them from a limited number of attacks. When their shield is depleted, it will break.

Healing Items:
Healing items will be randomly generated on the map. The protagonist can pick these items up to restore their health.

Debuffs:
Items that debuff the antagonist will be randomly generated on the map. When the protagonist collects these items, the antagonist will suffer effects such as their stamina being depleted, preventing them from attacking temporarily.

Unlockable Attacks:
The protagonist will gain points based on how long they survive. When certain point milestones are reached, new attacks will be unlocked for the antagonist to help scale the difficulty of the game and keep the game interesting.

Screen Wrap-around:
When the protagonist moves past a boundary of the playing field, they will reappear on the opposite side of the playing field. This prevents the protagonist’s movement from being restricted, helping to maintain the flow of the game as well as adding an extra layer of strategy that the player can use to their advantage.

Colours:
Players will be able to customise the colour of the paper plane, playing field and attacks using given palette options.
Speed:
Players will be able to customise the speed of the paper plane in order to adjust the difficulty to their preference.
